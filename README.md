# OpenInvaders

A simple, open-source Space Invaders like game.
More of an exercise in Java than a real game ('cuz the code sucks).

## Map
Editing the map is simple.  Open the .openinvaders directory in your home directory, and edit the map for the level you'd like to edit.

The files to edit are level1.txt, level2.txt, and so on.

### Map Key
S = Space Tile  
W = Wall Tile  

## How to Play
The goal is to clear the level you're on of enemy ships.

## Controls
W/UP = Move the ship up if the enemies have been cleared  
A/LEFT = Move the ship to the left  
S/DOWN = Move the ship down if the enemies have been cleared  
D/RIGHT = Move the ship to the right  
F = Change firing mode  
Space = Shoot

## Stuff for testers
J = Move up a level  
B = Move down a level  
K = Deplete the player's ammo
